# HeartDisease_AnalysisandEvaluation

World Health Organization has estimated that four out of five cardiovascular diseases(CVD) deaths are due to heart attacks .
This whole research intends to pinpoint the ratio of patients who possess a good chance of being affected by CVD and also to predict the overall risk using #####Logistic Regression .

### What is Logistic Regression ?
Logistic Regression(https://machinelearningmastery.com/logistic-regression-for-machine-learning/) is a statistical and machine-learning techniques classifying records of a dataset based on the values of the input fields . It predicts a dependent variable based on one or more set of independent variables to predict outcomes .
It can be used both for binary classification and multi-class  classification .
